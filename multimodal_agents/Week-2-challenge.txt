# Week 2 Challenge
Add more tools/Agents to enhance capabilities.

- Add an agent that translates all responses to a different language
and shows on the right hand side, using a different frontier model.

- Add another tool to make a booking, writing to a text file
or (added by me - connect to Airline API and check the prices).

-  Add an agent that can listen for audio and convert to text so you can speak
with the assistant directly.
