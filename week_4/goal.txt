# How to compare LLMs

Start with the basics
# Parameters
# Context length
# Pricing

The look at the results
# Benchmarks
# Leaderboards
# Arenas

# Basics #1
# Open source or closed
# Release data and knowledge cut off
# Parameters
# Training tokens
# Context length

# Basics #2
# Inference cost
# Training cost
# Built cost
# Time to market
# Rate limits
# Speed
# Latency
# License

# The Chinchilla Scaling Law
The number of Parameters ~ proportional to the number of training tokens

# The 7 common Benchmarks that you will often encounter

3 specific Benchmarks
# ELO - Chat - results from head-to-head face-offs with other LLMs, as with ELO in chess

# MultiPL-E Broader coding - across 18 languages

# Limitations of Benchmarks
# Non consistently applied
# Too narrow in scope
